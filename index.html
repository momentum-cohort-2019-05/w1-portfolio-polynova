    <p> My name is Jocelyn Casanova and I was originally born in Veracruz, Mexico which is a tropical state located on the gulf of Mexico. I moved to the states when I was 4 years old. I have since been adopted by North Carolina who has been my home ever since. </p>
<p> I am a person of many traits which in return fits my personality as well as my various skills. I have a strong passion for creating through various mediums such as painting, visual art, story telling and much more. I have shared my story of changing enviorments and how it has helped me grow more as a person. </p>
